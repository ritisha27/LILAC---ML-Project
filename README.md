## LILAC: ANALYZING LIFESTYLE AS RISK FACTOR FOR LUNG CANCER

- This project attempts to propose a detailed comparison of popular Machine Learning techniques with an aim to predict the risk of Lung Cancer effectively.
- This is accomplished by analyzing and refining attributes using feature selection techniques
such as Chi-square test and Sequential Feature Selection.
- Focuses on identifying the most relevant attributes that significantly contribute to predicting
the risk of Lung Cancer.
