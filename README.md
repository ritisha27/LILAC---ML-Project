# LILAC- ANALYZING LIFESTYLE AS RISK FACTOR FOR LUNG CANCER
Over the last few years, the modern-day lifestyle has evolved with an increasing count of people adopting sedentary living with continuous exposure to consistent stress and degrading environmental conditions. In such times, early detection of a major risk of developing a highly dreadful disease for timely medication may prove to be pivotal for Bio-Medicine Computational Sciences for improving human health. LILAC provides an automated solution to visualize, analyze, process, and hence predict the expected risk of Lung Cancer through available data records concerning the lifestyle of people. This project attempts to propose a detailed comparison of popular Machine Learning techniques with an aim to predict the risk effectively. This is achieved by analyzing and refining attributes using feature selection techniques such as the Chi-square test and Sequential Feature Selection. It focuses on identifying the most relevant attributes that significantly contribute to predicting the risk of Lung Cancer. The proposed work enhances the accuracy of models, which are relatively easy to build and explain, and hence improves the time complexity when the model is built with a huge amount of data available.
